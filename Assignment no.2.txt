Q.4 why isn't it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
ANS :
      When you select  a table the order of rows in the output, depends on the row address.
      It will always be in Ascending order of row address.
      When you update a row if the row length is increasing then the entire may be moved to some other address.
      Later when you select from table you will find the row at some other position in Output.
      Its only in the case of varchar that the row length may increase or decrease.
      Hence it is not possible to view the first and last ‘N’ rows of table.
