1.Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)? 
#1.CREATE VIEW Dailyorders AS SELECT DISTINCT cnum,snum,onum,odate FROM Orders;
ans. yes


#2.CREATE VIEW Custotals AS SELECT cname, SUM (amt) Sum_Amt
FROM Orders, Customers
WHERE Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum GROUP BY cname;
ans. Views are not updatable which consists of join.

#3.CREATE VIEW Thirdorders AS SELECT *
FROM Dailyorders WHERE odate=’1990-10-03’;

ans. not updatable due to distinct keyword in dailyorders;

#4.CREATE VIEW Nullcities AS SELECT snum,sname,city FROM Salespeople
WHERE city IS NULL OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ AND ‘M’;

ans. yes

Q2.Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include
only the snum and comm fields. Through this view, someone could enter or change
commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20. 

CREATE VIEW commission AS
SELECT snum,comm
FROM salespeople WHERE comm BETWEEN .10 AND .20;

SELECT * FROM commission;


INSERT INTO commission VALUES(3000,.4);



SELECT * FROM commission;

Q3.Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date,
sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”. The word SYSDATE can
therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the
value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the
Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the
Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is
given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given. 

create table ORDERS_DEMO03
(
    Onum int(5),
    Amt float(5,2),
    Odate date default (SYSDATE())
);

insert into ORDERS_DEMO03 (Onum, Amt) values (01, 2);
    
select * from ORDERS_DEMO03;

create view ENTRYORDERS as
select * from ORDERS_DEMO03 where Onum not in
(select Onum_Temp from (select Onum "Onum_Temp" from ORDERS_DEMO03) as TEMP) with check option; 

drop view ENTRYORDERS;        
        
create view ENTRYORDERS as
select * from ORDERS_DEMO03 where Onum in
(select Onum_Temp from
(select Onum Onum_Temp from ORDERS_DEMO03) as TEMP) with check option;
        
alter table ORDERS_DEMO03 add PRIMARY KEY (Onum);
